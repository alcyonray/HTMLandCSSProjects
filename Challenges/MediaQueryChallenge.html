            <h3>This page is about the best category of motorcycle, the Adventure bike.</h3>
            <p>Featured above is one of the premier offerings from KTM, and is their competition bike for the 2024 Dakar desert rally.
                Though different in many ways from their road-going machines, the undercurrent of untamable off-road capability is not 
                lost on the street legal adventure bikes.  Built for unmatched off-road capability, while touting long-range ability
                and comfort.  These motorcycles are really the best all around machines, for any flavor of rider.
